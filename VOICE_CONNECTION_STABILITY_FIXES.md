# Voice Connection Stability Fixes

## Issues Identified from Logs

1. **Connection Established but Drops**: The WebRTC connection was establishing successfully but then immediately disconnecting
2. **ICE State Issues**: Connection was going from "checking" to "disconnected" quickly
3. **Audio Playback Problems**: Remote audio might not be playing due to browser autoplay policies

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved SimplePeer Configuration**
- Added more STUN servers for better NAT traversal
- Enhanced ICE server configuration with proper transport policies
- Added explicit audio offer/answer options
- Improved bundle and RTCP policies for better connection stability

### 2. **Better ICE State Handling**
- Don't immediately fail on "disconnected" state (connections can recover)
- Only fail on "failed" or "closed" states
- Added better logging for ICE state transitions
- Improved error handling to allow recovery from certain errors

### 3. **Enhanced Audio Playback**
- Added volume control and metadata handling
- Improved audio element configuration with `playsInline`
- Added audio event listeners for debugging
- User interaction triggers audio playback (fixes autoplay policy issues)
- Added volume monitoring for debugging audio issues

### 4. **Connection Health Monitoring**
- Added periodic health checks every 15 seconds
- Monitor connection state and attempt recovery if needed
- Better error reporting to users when connections fail
- Automatic reconnection attempts for failed connections

### 5. **Browser Compatibility Improvements**
- Handle autoplay policy restrictions
- Enable audio on user interaction (microphone button click)
- Better error handling for different browser behaviors
- Added `playsInline` for mobile compatibility

## Expected Improvements

1. **More Stable Connections**: Connections should stay established longer
2. **Better Audio Playback**: Remote audio should play reliably
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Failed connections should attempt to recover
4. **Better User Feedback**: Clear messages about connection status
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Better support for mobile browsers

## Testing Steps

1. **Start voice call** - Should establish connection
2. **Check console logs** - Should see "Remote audio playing successfully"
3. **Listen for audio** - Should hear partner's voice
4. **Monitor connection** - Should see periodic health checks
5. **Test recovery** - Connection should attempt to recover if it drops

## Debug Information

The logs now include:
- ICE connection state changes
- Audio playback status
- Volume level detection
- Connection health metrics
- Recovery attempts

Look for these key messages:
- ‚úÖ "Remote audio playing successfully"
- üîä "Remote audio volume detected"
- üè• "Voice connection health"
- üîÑ "Connection lost, attempting to reconnect"

If you still can't hear audio, check:
1. Browser permissions for microphone
2. System audio settings
3. Network firewall settings
4. Console for specific error messages
