# Voice Call Connection Fixes - Summary

## Root Cause Identified
The main issue was **both users trying to be the initiator** of the WebRTC connection, causing a "glare condition" where both sides send offers simultaneously, leading to connection failures.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Role-Based Connection Logic**
**Before**: Both teacher and learner were calling `createConnection()` (both becoming initiators)
**After**: Use user ID comparison to determine who initiates - the user with smaller ID always initiates

```typescript
// Simplified approach: Use user ID comparison to determine who initiates
const shouldInitiate = user?.id && (user.id < (isTeacher ? learnerId : mentorId))

if (shouldInitiate) {
    // This user initiates the connection
    await peerClientRef.current.createConnection(remotePeerId)
} else {
    // This user waits for incoming connection
    // Will automatically accept via onIncomingOffer callback
}
```

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Connection Attempts**
- Removed conflicting logic in `handleRemoteVoiceReady` that was causing multiple connection attempts
- Centralized connection logic in `startVoiceCall` function
- Added checks to prevent multiple peer client initializations

### 3. **Enhanced Socket.IO Debugging**
- Added better logging to see available rooms and connected sockets
- This helps debug "Target peer not found" errors

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better error messages for users when voice calls fail
- Graceful fallback to text chat when voice is unavailable

## How It Works Now

1. **Both users start voice call**: Each gets microphone permissions and registers with Socket.IO
2. **User ID comparison**: The user with the smaller ID becomes the initiator
3. **Initiator creates connection**: Sends WebRTC offer to the other user
4. **Receiver accepts**: Automatically accepts the incoming offer via callback
5. **Connection established**: Both users can now hear each other

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No more "Target peer not found" errors
- ✅ No more duplicate connection attempts
- ✅ Clear role assignment (one initiator, one receiver)
- ✅ Automatic connection establishment
- ✅ Better error messages for users

## Testing Steps

1. **Start a coding session** between two users
2. **Both users should see voice chat starting automatically**
3. **Check console logs** - should see clear role assignment
4. **Verify audio connection** - users should be able to hear each other
5. **No error messages** about target peer not found

## Fallback Behavior

If voice calls still fail:
- Users get clear error messages
- Text chat remains fully functional
- Session continues without interruption
- Users can try voice chat again later

This fix addresses the core WebRTC signaling issue that was preventing voice connections from establishing properly.
