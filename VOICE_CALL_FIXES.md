# Voice Call and Infinite Loop Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket.IO Server Error
**Problem**: Socket.IO was returning "server error" causing voice calls to fail
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced error handling in Socket.IO server configuration
- Added proper CORS settings for development and production
- Added reconnection logic with retry attempts
- Improved timeout handling

### 2. Infinite Re-rendering Loop
**Problem**: The `checkForActiveSession` function was causing infinite re-renders
**Solution**:
- Memoized `checkForActiveSession` with `useCallback`
- Removed function from useEffect dependencies to prevent loops
- Added state check to prevent running when already in coding session
- Reduced retry attempts to prevent excessive API calls

### 3. Persistent "Session Resumed" Modal
**Problem**: Modal kept appearing repeatedly due to infinite session checks
**Solution**:
- Added `hasShownResumeModal` flag to show modal only once per session
- Reset flag when session ends or state resets
- Added check to prevent session check when already in coding session

### 4. Rapid Component Mounting/Unmounting
**Problem**: React Strict Mode and re-renders causing premature session ending
**Solution**:
- Increased minimum mount time from 3 to 10 seconds
- Better handling of component unmount vs re-render
- Preserve session during navigation/refresh

### 5. Voice Call Failure Handling
**Problem**: Poor user experience when voice calls fail
**Solution**:
- Better error messages explaining the issue
- Graceful fallback to text chat when voice fails
- Clear indication of voice chat status
- Automatic retry logic for connection issues

## Files Modified

1. **app/(dashboard)/live/page.tsx**
   - Fixed infinite loop with memoized callback
   - Added modal prevention flag
   - Improved session state management

2. **pages/api/socket.ts**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Better CORS configuration
   - Proper response handling

3. **lib/socketSignaling.ts**
   - Added reconnection logic
   - Better timeout handling
   - Improved error messages

4. **lib/simplePeerClient.ts**
   - Added timeout for initialization
   - Better error handling
   - Graceful degradation when Socket.IO fails

5. **components/coding/CollaborativeCoding.tsx**
   - Increased minimum mount time
   - Better voice call error handling
   - Improved user messaging

6. **lib/fallbackVoiceClient.ts** (New)
   - Fallback implementation for when Socket.IO fails
   - Maintains basic functionality without peer-to-peer

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Socket.IO Connection**:
   - Check if `/api/socket` endpoint responds correctly
   - Verify WebSocket upgrade works
   - Test on different networks (mobile, WiFi)

2. **Test Voice Call Flow**:
   - Start voice call and verify microphone permissions
   - Test connection between two users
   - Verify graceful failure when server is down

3. **Test Session Management**:
   - Verify no infinite loops in console
   - Check that modal appears only once
   - Test session persistence during refresh

4. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Block microphone permissions
   - Disconnect internet during call
   - Refresh page during active session

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for production CORS
   - Ensure Socket.IO server can handle WebSocket upgrades

2. **Server Configuration**:
   - Verify WebSocket support on hosting platform
   - Check firewall settings for Socket.IO ports
   - Test HTTPS compatibility for microphone permissions

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor Socket.IO connection errors
   - Track voice call success rates
   - Watch for infinite loop patterns in logs

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Status Indicators**:
   - Voice call connection status
   - Microphone permission status
   - Server availability status

2. **Better Error Messages**:
   - Specific guidance for different error types
   - Fallback options when features fail
   - Clear next steps for users

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Text chat always available
   - Session continues even if voice fails
   - No blocking errors that prevent coding

## Next Steps

1. **Add Health Checks**:
   - Periodic Socket.IO server health checks
   - Voice connection quality monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection attempts

2. **Improve Fallbacks**:
   - Alternative signaling methods
   - Better offline support
   - Progressive enhancement approach

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimize WebRTC connection setup
   - Minimize API calls during session
